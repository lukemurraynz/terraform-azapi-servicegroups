# Azure Service Groups - Platform Engineering Best Practices

This Terraform configuration deploys Azure Service Groups following enterprise-grade Platform Engineering and Application Team organizational patterns. The structure is designed to support cross-functional teams, clear separation of concerns, and effective governance at scale.

## 🏗️ Overview

Azure Service Groups provide a flexible way to organize and manage resources across subscriptions and resource groups, parallel to existing Azure resource hierarchy. This configuration implements a common enterprise pattern that separates:

- **Platform Engineering Teams**: Responsible for shared infrastructure, tooling, and developer experience
- **Application Teams**: Organized by business domains and product areas
- **Security & Compliance**: Cross-cutting security and governance services

## 🌳 Service Group Hierarchy

### Platform Engineering
**Purpose**: Provides shared infrastructure, tooling, and developer experience across the organization

- **Platform Infrastructure**: Core infrastructure services (networking, security, monitoring, shared services)
- **Platform DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, developer self-service platforms
- **Platform Data**: Data platform services (data lakes, analytics, ML platforms, data governance)

### Application Teams
**Purpose**: Business-focused teams organized by domains and product areas

- **Customer Experience**: Customer-facing applications
  - **E-commerce Platform**: Shopping cart, payment processing, inventory management
  - **Customer Support**: Ticketing systems, knowledge base, chat platforms
- **Internal Operations**: Internal business applications
  - **Finance Systems**: Accounting, budgeting, financial reporting, compliance
  - **Human Resources**: Employee management, payroll, benefits, talent acquisition

### Security & Compliance
**Purpose**: Cross-cutting security and governance services

- **Identity & Access Management**: Azure AD, conditional access, privileged access management

### Service Group Members
This configuration includes examples of adding Azure resources to service groups through **Service Group Member** relationships:

1. **Storage Account Member**: The storage account `stgaccountlk` is added to the Security & Compliance service group
2. **Resource Group Member**: The `openai` resource group is added to the E-commerce Platform service group

These examples demonstrate how to:
- Connect existing Azure resources and resource groups to service groups
- Enable cross-subscription resource grouping
- Provide unified governance and monitoring across resources
- Support different resource types (individual resources and resource containers)

## 📋 Best Practices

### 1. **Organizational Alignment**
- Service Groups align with actual team structures and responsibilities
- Clear ownership and accountability for each group
- Supports Conway's Law - team structure matches system architecture

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- Platform teams focus on infrastructure and shared services
- Application teams focus on business value delivery
- Security teams provide cross-cutting concerns

### 3. **Scalability**
- Hierarchical structure supports up to 10 levels of nesting
- Each subscription can have up to 2,000 service group memberships
- Tenant limit of 10,000 service groups (preview)

### 4. **Governance**
- Role assignments inherit only to child Service Groups
- No automatic inheritance to member resources (principle of least privilege)
- Clear audit trail and access management

### 5. **Naming Conventions**
- Use lowercase with hyphens for consistency
- Include team/domain context in names
- Keep names descriptive but concise


## 👥 Team Responsibilities

### Platform Engineering Teams
- **Infrastructure**: Networking, security, monitoring, shared services
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, developer tooling
- **Data**: Data platforms, analytics, ML infrastructure, governance

### Application Teams
- **Customer Experience**: User-facing applications and experiences
- **Internal Operations**: Business process applications and systems

### Security & Compliance
- **Identity & Access**: Authentication, authorization, access management
- **Governance**: Policy enforcement, compliance monitoring, audit

## 🔐 Governance & Security

### Access Management
- Use Azure RBAC for fine-grained access control
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and auditing

### Monitoring & Compliance
- Centralized monitoring and alerting
- Policy enforcement through Azure Policy
- Audit logging and compliance reporting

### Best Practices
- Use managed identities where possible
- Implement proper key management with Azure Key Vault
- Enable monitoring and alerting for all resources
- Regular security reviews and vulnerability assessments

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review and update service group memberships
- Audit access permissions quarterly
- Update documentation as teams evolve
- Monitor resource usage and costs

### Troubleshooting
- Check operation status for async operations
- Use Azure-AsyncOperation header for status checks
- Validate service group global uniqueness
- Monitor provisioning states
